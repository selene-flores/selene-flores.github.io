Manoa Marketplace is a web application that I helped create as a team project in ICS 314, Spring 2023. This project helped me learn how to design and implement a responsive web site.

Manoa Marketplace is implemented using [Meteor](http://meteor.com), a JavaScript application platform. Within three weeks, we created a fully functional website that allows students to create listings for items they'd like to sell or inversely for buyers to get in contact with sellers.

In this project, I gained experience with full-stack web application design and associated technologies, including [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com) for database storage, the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS Framework for the user interface, and Javascript for both client and server-side programming. We were also able to deploy the website which you can visit using this [link](http://manoa-marketplace.site). For more information regarding this project, please feel free to visit the project's [homepage](http://manoamarketplace.github.io/).
