The final project of my ECON 425 course from Fall 2022 was a research project. We were tasked with performing a regression analysis on the dataset of our choosing. Prior to doing so, we had to formulate a hypothesis about the relationship(s), if any, each variable had on the other. In the end, the regression analysis would provide us with more information so that we can reject or fail to reject the aforementioned hypothesis.

The dataset I used featured individuals' marital status, income, education level, mental well-being, and physical well-being. The initial intent of the project was to seek how mental well-being was impacted by any of the other variables. I was unable to make this hypothesis because it did not meet the requirements of the multiple regression model.


Below is a snippet of the summary statistic table, including the code that was used to render it.
