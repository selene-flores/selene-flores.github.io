  <p><em>Don’t ask dumb questions!</em></p>

<p>According to Raymond in “How To Ask Questions The Smart Way,” smart questions are concise yet easy to understand, has little to no grammatical errors present, and convenient for its target audience. The question should be explicit without incorporating unnecessary details as to not bore nor confuse the reader. It should also be easy to understand which, in turn, makes it easier to reply to. Grammatical or spelling errors may take away from the question as the reader will be too busy trying to comprehend the words instead. Lastly, it should be convenient. The individual you are asking assistance from should not have to jump through hoops to answer your question.It should be a stipulation in their contract that software engineers must ask smart questions. They are responsible for a myriad of duties which can include developing new software and its accompanying documentation, maintaining software in terms of troubleshooting issues, performing updates, and brainstorming improvements, and working with clients to confer on product expectations. Under the wide net of their tasks, engineers collaborate with other professionals who specialize in disciplines such as data science and front-end development, depending on the team’s objectives. By asking smart questions, they improve their interpersonal relationship with their peers, receive guidance in a timely manner, and improve productivity rate. Inversely, continuously asking !smart questions may lead to scrutiny, delayed productivity, and an unpleasant work environment.</p>

<h1 id="the-dont">The Don’t</h1>
<p>A contributor on StackOverFlow posted a question titled, “Can an if be written inside an if in c code?”, eliciting only 4 responses; two of which commented on what pieces of information the question was lacking. In their summary, they describe the hardware they’re working with, the ideal outcome, and slightly expands on the problem they’re experiencing. The question is one example of a “not so smart question”, because they neglect to include important details like the source code. Including the source code allows other contributors to trace it and pinpoint changes that need to be made. On the other hand, the details that they managed to provide were difficult to grasp due to the structure of the question. As a result, none of the comments given provided any real solution towards solving the question.</p>

<h1 id="the-do">The Do</h1>
<p>I believe that people are more inclined to engage and offer assistance if the question is ‘smart.’ For example, this question garnered 21 responses; some of which not only contained solutions but expanded on its processes. Those who contributed answers were also more polite, seemingly eager to help. What did this contributor do correctly? The question was not overtly long yet it provided sufficient detail because the wording choice was concise. They also included the source code for further reference.</p>
