  <p><em>Is Javascript right for you?</em></p>

<p>Although Javascript takes a little getting used to, I appreciate how painless it is to become acclimated to the syntax. I have not had the same experience with low-level languages such as C and C++. Javascript also seems to be a very forgiving language because I am able to get away with things like not declaring variables as it’ll simply infer the type of variable based on the value assigned at runtime.</p>

<p>##User-friendly</p>

<p>During the module, I also noticed an emphasis on ‘cutting down’ the code so that it is not extremely long and tedious. From a software engineering perspective, I would perceive this to be an asset especially when working on larger projects.</p>

<p>##Your brain is a muscle; it needs to be worked out, too.</p>

<p>The concept of athletic software engineering is entirely foreign to me, though I understand the need for it. This is applicable to anything; the more we practice, the better we should become. So far, I have really enjoyed the practice WODs. It is fun to compete against yourself. It has been challenging and frustrating at times but becoming good at something takes being bad at first. The group WOD we were assigned recently was also very fun. My partner and I clicked well together and contributed equally. It was an interesting experience to get real-time help from a peer of the same level as opposed to browsing the Internet for hours only to find an overly complicated answer that I cannot comprehend.</p>
