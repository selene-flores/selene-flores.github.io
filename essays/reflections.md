  Software Engineers are aptly called that because in conjunction with their technical expertise, they implement engineering principles to perform an array of tasks. They are usually responsible for the the development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. While these tasks all mention software applications, each one requires a specific skill set. For example, a software engineer must be able to write and test their code. They must possess good communication skills in order to collaborate effectively with fellow engineers, developers, data scientists, and even clients or stakeholders. They must take in data to make informed decisions towards optimizing software. These can come in forms of software updates or bug fix releases. At this point, we can conclude that software engineers are probably a very stressed group of people. Thankfully, there are a myriad of tools and practices that software engineers can pick up to better prepare them for what lies ahead. In this essay, I will touch on three of these concepts, chosen based on my level of interest.
  
*Open Source Development*

*Functional Programming*
  
*IDE*

While studying the C language, the professor who was teaching the course highly suggested we use vim for writing, editing, and compiling our code. This was not an easy feat; I had gotten accustomed to the ease of use that IDEs offered. I was frustrated a lot in the beginning. I found myself stumbling over having to continuously switch between insert and command mode to traverse the file or edit it. Although the commands eventually came in handy, it took a significant amount of time to memorize them. Then I had to force myself to practice them so that the act would be second-nature. When it got overwhelming, I'd switch to the TextEdit application to give my brain a break. Unfortunately, the compilation step had no such shortcuts. First, the file containing the source code has to be compiled with the gcc compiler. If no errors are detected, an object file is created and from that, an executable. I'm making it sound like a lengthy process when really, this can be done in one line. I'd still argue that the process is longer when other options allow you to perform the compilation in the click of a button.
