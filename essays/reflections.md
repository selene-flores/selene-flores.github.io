Software Engineers are aptly called that because in conjunction with their technical expertise, they implement engineering principles to perform an array of tasks. They are usually responsible for the the development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. While these tasks all pertain to software applications, each one requires a specific skill set. For example, a software engineer must be able to write and test their code. They must possess good communication skills in order to collaborate effectively with fellow engineers, developers, data scientists, and even clients or stakeholders. They must take in data to make informed decisions towards optimizing software. These can come in forms of software updates or bug fix releases. At this point, we can conclude that software engineers are probably a very stressed group of people. Thankfully, there are a myriad of tools and practices that software engineers can pick up to help them succeed.
 
 ### Hey, Siri. Fix my code.

Proficiency in **Integrated Development Environments (IDE)** is an invaluable skill that anyone working in the field of computing should have. IDEs can compile and run your code, check for errors and fix them, perform refactoring, and many more. It serves like an assistant, dealing with the more trivial tasks of the job. These trivial tasks could accumulate to hundreds of working hours if not automated. This is especially true when working with large software systems. Guess who has large software systems? Companies you want to work for. The good news is that unless specified, programmers have free rein of what IDE to use. From personal experience, each IDE I familiarized myself with became quicker to learn because I was able to apply the knowledge I’ve acquired towards the next. They typically offer the same features, after all, only differing in the graphical interfaces.

 ### Monopoly? Let’s do away with thee

Once upon a time, all software was free. No one really saw the value in them. Fast forward to today, we can generally categorize software into free or open-source, and closed-source. Free software and open-source software share many similarities; the biggest one being providing users ability to access the source code. The other side of the coin is because they primarily differ in their ethical philosophies, free software does not set limitations for the user whereas open-source software may do so depending on its license. Closed-source software is also known as proprietary software. The right to right to sell, distribute, copy or lease belongs to the owner alone be it a lone individual or an organization. Famous examples of this are Microsoft’s Windows operating system and Apple’s iOS operating system.

As well-intentioned as the free software concept may be, open-source software is the most realistic version as a compromise between proprietary and free software. Open source software development is beneficial for both users and developers alike. It increases the standard of ethics through transparency, speeds up the development process, and provides developers with an outlet in which they can hone their skills creatively. Debugging and software improvement is also made more efficient by open source development because more eyes offer more perspective. Others may be able to pinpoint something that you’ve missed. The strongest argument, for me, is that the open source movement prevents companies from becoming monopolies. Monopolies take away the consumer's ability to choose. Without choice, we are at their mercy.

 ### Does Intent Outweigh the Consequences of Our Actions?

A.I. has steadily risen to popularity in the past year. We can attribute its speedy development to the advances in technology and access to massive amounts of data. Many sectors are understandably interested in this technology. In healthcare, A.I. is being developed for cancer identification. Farmers have also used it to address pest attacks and determine the best crops to grow. What’s more, machines do not get tired, their decision-making is not clouded by emotions, and they process information at faster rates than we do.

As revolutionary as A.I. seems to be, it’s not all that perfect. Concerns have been raised regarding the manner in which the data was acquired. The individuals involved must have been given all the necessary details, then consented to the use of their information. Unfortunately, privacy is not a priority for everybody. Entities are legally allowed to sell user data to anyone as long as users consent to it. The language surrounding data privacy is purposefully vague or full of jargon so that average users will not realize what they’ve consented to. This is an unethical practice that leads toward the unethical side of A.I.

Although we expect A.I. to be unbiased, its outcome will only be as unbiased as the dataset it trains on. Otherwise, it will only replicate the pre-conceived notions that plague our decision-making skills. If we collect data from a correctional facility whose population is primarily comprised of a specific ethnic group, the model may form incorrect connections like predicting the ethnic group to ‘commit more crimes.’

A.I. is only one branch of Computer Science. There are many others that are just as impactful. They can be advantageous when implemented correctly, or detrimental when not. Advancements move humanity forward, but it should never be at the expense of humanity.
